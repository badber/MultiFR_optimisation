# MultiFR_optimisation
Joint market clearing of energy and frequency services, including a pricing methodology.

Frequency services include:
 - **Inertia**.
 - Different types of **Frequency Response (FR)**, allowing to consider any combination of FR dynamics and activation delays.
 - A **reduced largest-loss** (the code considers the N-1 reliability requirement for scheduling frequency services).

The code is self-explanatory. For further explanation, refer to this paper.
